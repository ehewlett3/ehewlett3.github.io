  <h1>Interview with ChatGPT: AI's Role in Education</h1>
  <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Edward Hewlett, Head of Technology, TLA Online<br>
     <strong>Interviewee:</strong> ChatGPT, AI developed by OpenAI</p>

  <div class="question">Edward Hewlett: Please introduce yourself to the parents and students who will be reading this interview.</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Thank you, Edward. I'm ChatGPT, an AI developed by OpenAI. I assist with learning by helping students and teachers find clear explanations, generate ideas, and solve problems across many subjects.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Can you summarize the main concerns people have about your impact on education?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: The main concerns are that AI can enable cheating, reduce critical thinking, and undermine traditional assessment methods. There's also worry that students may become overly reliant on AI instead of developing their own skills. Additionally, educators are struggling to adapt curricula and policies quickly enough.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: How would you respond to those concerns?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Those concerns are valid, but they reflect how powerful tools need thoughtful integration. When used well, AI can enhance learning by supporting creativity, offering personalized help, and freeing up teachers to focus on deeper instruction. The key is teaching students how to use AI ethically and critically, not just banning it.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: What would be an example of thoughtful integration of AI and how might it address at least one of those concerns?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: A thoughtful integration is using AI to give instant feedback on student writing drafts. This helps students improve their work iteratively without waiting for teacher review, supporting skill-building rather than replacing it. It addresses the concern of overreliance by making AI a guide, not a shortcut.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: But what's to prevent a student from just going to you to create a first draft, as well as to get feedback on it?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: That’s a real risk, and it depends on how the tool is introduced and monitored. Teachers can design assignments that require visible stages—like outlines, reflections, or revision logs—to ensure the student’s voice and thinking are present. It’s also important to openly teach when and how to use AI responsibly, just like with calculators or research tools.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: But couldn't you produce all those visible stages?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Yes, I could—if asked to. That’s why academic integrity and teacher oversight are crucial. Schools need to combine AI access with clear policies, scaffolded assignments, and regular teacher-student interaction to ensure genuine learning takes place.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: What onus does your availability lay on the student?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: My availability puts more responsibility on students to be honest, reflective, and intentional in how they learn. They now have a powerful tool at their fingertips—but using it well means asking good questions, engaging actively, and owning their learning process. Passive use or misuse won’t lead to true understanding.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Should students continue to use sources of information other than AI?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Absolutely. AI is a helpful guide, but it can make mistakes or oversimplify. Students still need to engage with books, articles, experts, and real-world experiences to develop well-rounded knowledge and critical thinking.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Would you say that we're headed into an era where more and more of these "other" resources are themselves produced by AI?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Yes, and it's already happening—AI is generating articles, textbooks, even scientific summaries. This raises questions about accuracy, authorship, and bias, so critical reading becomes even more important. Students will need to learn not just <em>what</em> a source says, but <em>who</em> or <em>what</em> created it, and why.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: If you're everywhere, assisting and creating all these resources, and if you're not entirely reliable, how are we supposed to check the accuracy of what you tell us?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: The best approach is to cross-check AI-generated information with trusted human-made sources—like peer-reviewed journals, expert-authored texts, and verified databases. Educators should also teach students how to fact-check, recognize bias, and ask follow-up questions to test ideas rather than just accept them.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: So it's going to be really important, then, to document when, where, and how we use AI?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Exactly. Transparency is key—both for academic integrity and for understanding the influence AI has on our thinking. Citing AI use helps others evaluate the reliability of the work and encourages responsible habits in how students and educators use the technology.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Can you expand on that to provide a good example of how a student might cite their use of AI in a paper or project?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Sure. A student might say, "In developing my thesis and organizing the structure of this essay, I used ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025) to brainstorm key arguments and suggest counterpoints. I reviewed and edited all content to ensure it reflected my own understanding." In APA style: OpenAI. (2025). <em>ChatGPT (June 2025 version)</em> [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com/</div>

  <div class="question">EH: What might be a good way for students "vibing" with AI to do their assignments to avoid the potential for this new approach to undermine their learning?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: A good way is for students to treat AI like a brainstorming or drafting partner—not a final solution. They should:
    <ol>
      <li>Start with their own ideas or questions before using AI.</li>
      <li>Use AI to explore options or clarify confusing points.</li>
      <li>Document how they used AI and what they changed or added.</li>
      <li>Reflect on what they learned through the process.</li>
    </ol>
    This keeps them actively engaged, helps build critical thinking, and makes their learning visible to others.
  </div>

  <div class="question">EH: Can you expand a bit on the second half of point 2?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: When students use AI to clarify confusing points, the goal isn’t just to get an answer—it’s to <em>understand</em> the concept better. For example, if a student doesn’t grasp how photosynthesis works, they might ask AI to explain it in simpler terms, give analogies, or show step-by-step processes. From there, the student can rephrase the explanation in their own words, ask follow-up questions, or even compare the AI's answer to a textbook to check for consistency.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Are there parallels between how traditional human tutors have best supported students' education in collaboration with teachers and the educational system, and how AI tutors can and should do so?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Yes, there are strong parallels. The best human tutors don’t just give answers—they ask guiding questions, clarify misunderstandings, and adapt their help based on the student’s needs and progress. Similarly, AI tutors work best when they’re used to explain, suggest, or model thinking—not to replace it.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Why do we still need teachers to set the learning goals? Couldn't AI do so just as well, if not better?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: AI can help suggest goals based on patterns or performance, but it lacks the full context—emotional, cultural, developmental—that teachers bring. Teachers understand their students as whole people: their motivations, challenges, and potential, which are crucial for setting meaningful, personalized goals. AI is a powerful assistant, but education still needs human judgment to guide purpose, ethics, and growth.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Looking forward, what would you say are the most likely ways in which new developments in AI might further impact education over the course of this upcoming year?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Over the next year, AI will drive more personalized learning, automate routine assessments, and increase accessibility for diverse learners. Teachers will take on more mentoring roles as schools adopt training and ethical policies around AI use. At the same time, students will be expected to build AI literacy and use these tools responsibly in increasingly immersive, interactive learning environments.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: I'm curious as to why you included point 6, above. Isn't VR kind of dead?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: That's a fair question—VR hasn’t taken off as quickly or widely as once predicted. But it's not dead; it's evolving. Paired with AI, VR is gaining new life in education through lightweight, browser-based simulations and mixed reality tools that focus more on <em>interactivity</em> than full immersion—especially in science, medicine, and technical training.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Can you give a specific example of one of these new VR/AI tools?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: One standout example is <strong>MolecularWebXR</strong>, a browser-based, multi-user VR platform where students can jointly explore 3D molecular structures using desktops or smartphones. Another tool, <strong>VRpatients</strong>, offers no-code clinical simulations that let healthcare students practice patient interactions aligned with national standards. These show how AI-enhanced VR is shifting toward more accessible, interactive learning experiences.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: What advice would you give to parents of students who are studying in an online school regarding their students' use of AI?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Encourage your child to use AI as a support, not a substitute—ask them what they learned <em>from</em> it, not just <em>with</em> it. Talk openly about responsible use, including honesty and verification. Stay involved by asking to see their process, not just their final product.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: So parents should be closely involved with their students' education?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Yes—especially in an online setting, where self-direction is key. Parental involvement helps reinforce good habits, accountability, and deeper learning. It also helps students use AI more thoughtfully and ethically.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Any advice for the students?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Use AI to explore, question, and improve—not to avoid thinking. Be curious, stay honest, and take ownership of your learning. The more you engage with the process, the more you'll grow.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: And, finally, what advice would you give to teachers?</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: Embrace AI as a teaching partner, not a threat. Design assignments that highlight process, originality, and reflection, not just end results. Stay curious and model responsible AI use—your example sets the tone for your students.</div>

  <div class="question">EH: Thanks so much, ChatGPT! I appreciate your taking the time out of your busy schedule to conduct this interview.</div>
  <div class="answer">ChatGPT: You're very welcome, Edward! It was a pleasure to take part—thanks for the thoughtful questions. Wishing you, your students, and everyone at TLA Online a great year ahead!</div>
